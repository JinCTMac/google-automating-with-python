Methods to modify lists

Adding an element to a list - the .append() method
  Append adds an item to the end of a list, like .push() in JS and Ruby.

Adding an element to a list in a specific index position - the .insert() method
  Insert takes 2 parameters, the index position you want to insert at, and the value of that index. It shifts every item after it by 1 if inserted between the first and the last, and if inserted to an element higher than the current length, it inserts at the end of the list.

Removing elements from a list - the .remove() method
  Removes gets rid of the first occurrence of the element passed to it. If the element doesn't not exist, it throws an error.

Removing elements from a list at a given index position - the .pop() method
  Pop takes 2 parameters, the index position and the element you want to remove.

Reassigning elemements - list[index] = value
  You can simply reassign the value of an element in a list.
