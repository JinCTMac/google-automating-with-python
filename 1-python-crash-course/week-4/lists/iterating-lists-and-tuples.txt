Iterating over lists and tuples

We can loop over a list using a simple for loop:

animals = ["Lion", "Monkey", "Elephant"]
chars = 0

for animal in animals:
  chars += len(animal)

print("Chars: {chars} Average chars: {avgchars}").format(chars=chars, avgchars=chars/len(animals))

What if you wanted to know the index of an element while going through the list?

You can just use the enumerate function.

The enumerate function works with a for loop to return a tuple for each element in the list.

people = ["John", "Maria", "Takeuchi"]

for index, person in enumerate(people):
  print("{} - {}").format(index, person)

Now a slightly more complex function that takes a list containing tuples of people's email address and name and formatting it into a new list:

def full_emails(people):
  result = []
  for email, name in people:
    result.append("{} <{}>".format(name, email))
  return result
