List Comprehension

We can create lists in a shorter way. If we want to create a list of multiples of 7 from 7 to 70, we can make them using a range.

multiples = []
for i in range(1,11):
  multiples.append(i*7)

But because making lists based on sequences is so common, Python lets us use list comprehension to do that instead.

multiples = [ x * 7 for x in range(1,11)]

will output the same result as the above.

We can add conditional clauses to list comprehensions.

multiples_3 = [ x for x in range(0,101) if x % 3 == 0]

Which only returns multiples of 3.
