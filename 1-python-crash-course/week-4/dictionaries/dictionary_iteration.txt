Iterating over a Dictionary

For loops
You can use for loops to iterate over a dictionary.

file_counts = {
  "py": 23,
  "txt": 12,
  "js": 59
}

for extension in file_counts:
  print(extension)

The for loop will print just the values of each key in the dictionary.
Or you can use the item method, which returns a tuple for each element in the dictionary.

for extension, amount in file_counts.items():
  print("There are {} files with the .{} extension).format(amount, extension)

Or you can just use .keys() and .values() to access the keys and values.

for value in file_counts.values():
  print value

As each key can be present only once, dictionaries are great for counting frequency.

For example, if we wanted to count each occurance of a letter in a piece of text, we can make a function to do this for us.

def count_letter(text):
  frequency_chart = {}
  for letter in text:
    if letter not in frequency_chart:
      frequency_chart[letter] = 0
    frequency_chart[letter] += 1
  return frequency_chart
