What is a Dictionary?

The equivalent of a hash or an object in Ruby/JS.
We don't access elements inside dictionaries using positions, as dictionary entries take key-value pairs. We can use several data-types for the keys, including strings, integers, tuples, etc.

The key is the word, the value is the definition.

Dictionaries use {} brackeets.

dict = {
  first: "cool",
  second: "not cool"
}
