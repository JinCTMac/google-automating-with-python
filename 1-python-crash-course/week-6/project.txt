About Jupyter Notebooks
We use codeblocks to write small snippets of code. We can use Jupyter Notebooks for Python, which is a special kind of document that contains pieces of code. The notebooks can also contain text, widgets and other things, allowing us to tell interactive stories with our code. We can run and edit our code in the web browser, and can also document/describe the code.

We execute the code by running or using command + enter.
Jupyter notebooks execute one by one, where we can execute each code block individually.

Project Intro
Writing a script from the ground up

How do we break down a problem into smaller steps that we can solve?
Imagine we have a situation where we need to write a report telling us what users are using what machines at any given time. We need to figure out:

- What data we're using as input
- What data we're getting as output

We can work this out by looking at the rest of the system where our script will live, and look at the attributes that we're accessing and using for inputs. Our script receives event objects, and we access the event object attributes for the login and logout data, looking for the names of the users who have logged in. Ultimately, we need to look at event objects, getting date, user, machine and type details and then generate a report that logs all of those details.

Figuring out how we go about doing this.
