Classes and Objects in Python

We used the .type() function to test what type a variable is. The .type() function returns the Class that the variable belongs to. The String class for instance has methods like .upper() and .isnumeric(). Each string we've used has been a different instance of the string class, so the result of calling those methods on each instance would be different as well.

If you want to see all the methods associated with a class, we can call the dir method on a variable to see all the methods associated with that class.

The help() method gives us the documentation for that class.
