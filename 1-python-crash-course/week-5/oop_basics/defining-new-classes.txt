Defining new classes in Python

Classes in Python are defined using the Class keyword.

Class Fruit:
  pass

Class names in Python should start with a capital letter.
To add attributes, we do that underneath the class definition.
The pass keyword is used to indicate that nothing happens, and that the class is empty, which is needed for correct syntax in some cases.

Class Fruit:
  color: ""
  flavour: ""

Once we have a body for the class, we don't need the pass keyword. Now we can create instances of the class like so.

apple = Fruit()

To create a new instance of any class, we call the class name with brackets like it were a function.

apple.color = "Red"
apple.flavour = "Tasty"
print(apple.color)

To set the attributes, we can do so like this. We use . notation to access the attributes of an object instance, or the methods for that instance.
