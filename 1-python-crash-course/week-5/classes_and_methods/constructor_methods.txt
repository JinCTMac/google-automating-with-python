Constructor methods

Up to now, we've been creating classes with empty attribute values and setting them after we create an instance. But this isn't ideal, as we can forget to set a particular value. When writing code, it's a good idea to do things early to prevent them from going wrong later. So we should set the attributes at the start, using a Constructor.

The constructor of a class is the method that is called when you call the name of the class. The constructor method is defined using two underscores __, indicating it is a very special class.

class Apple:
  def __init__(self, color, flavor):
    self.color = color
    self flavor = flavor

The constructor method, or the initialise method, takes 3 parameters - the self, which means that the attributes will always refer to the instance of the class being created, and then the attributes you want, which you set with self.attribute = attribute. This allows us to set the values of a class right when we create them, just like in Ruby with the initialise method.
